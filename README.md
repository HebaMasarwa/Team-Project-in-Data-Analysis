## Project Overview

This project involves collaborative efforts to analyze and visualize data related to [briefly describe the project focus]. We utilize Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Tableau for data visualization.


**Remote Work Survey in New South Wales**: Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work has become integral to modern workplaces. This survey, based on data from Maven Analytics - Remote Work Survey, gathered insights from 1,500 remote workers in New South Wales during 2020.
